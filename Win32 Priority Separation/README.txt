WIN32 PRIORITY SEPARATION
The registry files in this folder can impact the FPS, input
latency, hit reg, and overall feel of your games. In theory,
long values are better for smoothness, and short values are 
better for latency. There is no best value, because everyone
has different hardware, games, needs, and preferences. These
values are here for testing, and there is no need to restart
your computer after applying them.
