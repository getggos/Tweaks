# ggOS Optional Tweaks
The tweaks in these folders are optional. They may impact the
FPS, input latency, hit reg, and overall feel of your games.
There is no best value, because everyone has different games,
hardware, needs and preferences. What may be great for you
may be horrible for someone else, and vice versa. They are 
here for your testing. Except for Win32 Priorities, you must
restart your computer after applying each tweak.
